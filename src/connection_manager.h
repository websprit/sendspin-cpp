/**
 * @brief Manages WebSocket connection lifecycle.
 *
 * Accepts and creates connections, handles the hello handshake, orchestrates server handoff
 * decisions, and performs graceful disconnection with deferred cleanup.
 *
 * Connections prove themselves before they are trusted: every new connection enters a bounded
 * nursery and leaves it only by completing the hello handshake (promotion, or a fair comparison
 * against the incumbent) or by missing the establish deadline (reaped). The platform ws_server
 * delivers inbound connections only after observing their WebSocket upgrade, so the manager never
 * reasons about raw sockets that might not speak WebSocket; those are closed inside the platform
 * layer. Invariant: `current_connection_ != nullptr` implies
 * `current_connection_->is_handshake_complete()`.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 *  1. Construct with a `SendspinClient*`.
 *  2. Call `init_server()` once to create and configure the WebSocket server.
 *  3. Call `loop()` periodically to drive connection state, process deferred events, and retry
 *     hellos.
 *  4. Call `connect_to()` to initiate an outgoing client connection when needed.
 *  5. Call `disconnect()` to gracefully close the active connection.
 *
 * @code
 * ConnectionManager manager(client);
 * manager.init_server(client, use_psram, priority);
 *
 * while (running) {
 *     manager.loop();
 * }
 *
 * manager.disconnect(SendspinGoodbyeReason::SHUTDOWN);
 * @endcode

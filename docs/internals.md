# Sendspin-cpp Internals

This document describes the internal architecture of the sendspin-cpp library, focusing on threading, inter-class communication, and the ordering guarantees that keep everything correct.

## Pimpl Architecture

Each role class uses the pimpl (pointer to implementation) pattern. The public header (`include/sendspin/<role>_role.h`) exposes only the consumer-facing API: protocol types, the listener interface, and a thin role class with `struct Impl; std::unique_ptr<Impl> impl_;`. All private state, internal methods, and thread-management code live in a private impl header (`src/<role>_role_impl.h`) and the corresponding `.cpp` file.

`SendspinClient` is a `friend` of each role class, giving it access to `impl_->` for internal dispatch (message routing, event draining, lifecycle management). The `SyncTask` holds a `PlayerRole::Impl*` directly (passed at init time), so it accesses player state without indirection through the public `PlayerRole` class.

Throughout this document, internal field and method references use the `Impl` qualification (e.g., `PlayerRole::Impl::drain_events()`) to reflect the actual code location.

## Conditional Compilation

Roles can be disabled at build time via `SENDSPIN_ENABLE_*` (CMake options on host, Kconfig entries on ESP-IDF). Two mechanisms cooperate, with a strict boundary between them:

1. **CMake source-list exclusion** (`cmake/sources.cmake`). Each role has its own `SENDSPIN_<ROLE>_SOURCES` list. When a role is disabled, its translation units are not added to the build, so the code never compiles and its transitive dependencies are not required; e.g., micro-flac and micro-opus for the player. The ESP-IDF component manifest (`idf_component.yml`) similarly gates the audio codec dependencies on `SENDSPIN_ENABLE_PLAYER` so they are not even fetched.
2. **`#ifdef SENDSPIN_ENABLE_<ROLE>` guards** in `include/sendspin/client.h` and `src/client.cpp`. These are the only core files that must reference role types directly (the `std::unique_ptr<RoleClass>` members, `add_*()` / accessor declarations, and dispatch branches in message handlers). Nowhere else in the core should use these guards.

The split exists because the two problems are different. CMake handles "don't compile this file and don't require its dependencies," while `#ifdef` handles "core code needs to conditionally mention a type." Using `#ifdef` to gate entire files would still force the codec headers onto the include path; using CMake to gate individual member declarations is not possible.

As a consequence, role-only headers;e.g., `src/decoder.h`, which pulls in `<micro_flac/flac_decoder.h>` and `<opus.h>`, must only be reachable through role-only sources or through `#ifdef`-guarded includes in `client.cpp`. Public role headers in `include/sendspin/` must remain free of codec dependencies so that core files like `src/transfer_buffer.cpp` and `src/protocol_messages.h` can include them unconditionally.

When adding a new role, the checklist is: add a `SENDSPIN_<ROLE>_SOURCES` list in `cmake/sources.cmake`, add the member/accessor/dispatch guards in `client.h` and `client.cpp`, and keep any heavy dependencies behind the role's private headers.

A separate `#ifdef` axis lives in `src/platform/`: headers there use `#ifdef ESP_PLATFORM` to select between ESP-IDF (FreeRTOS, `heap_caps_malloc`, `esp_log`, etc.) and host (std primitives, `malloc`, `printf`) implementations behind a common API. This is orthogonal to role selection; the split is between build targets, not features. Core sources outside `src/platform/`, `src/esp/`, and `src/host/` should never use `#ifdef ESP_PLATFORM` directly, so platform differences stay isolated to the abstraction layer.

## Thread Model

The library uses a small number of long-lived threads. All state mutations and user-facing callbacks happen on the caller's main loop thread unless explicitly noted otherwise.

### Threads

| Thread | Name | Created by | Stack (ESP) | Priority (ESP) | Purpose |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Main loop** | (caller's) | User code | - | - | Drives `SendspinClient::loop()`. All role event processing and listener callbacks run here. |
| **Sync task** | `Sendspin` | `PlayerRole::Impl::start()` → `SyncTask::start()` | 6192 B | 2 | Decodes audio, synchronizes to server timestamps, writes PCM to the audio sink via `on_audio_write`. |
| **Visualizer drain** | `SsVis` | `VisualizerRole::Impl::start()` | 4096 B | 2 | Reads visualization frames from a ring buffer and delivers them to the listener at the correct playback time. |
| **Artwork decode** | `SsArt` | `ArtworkRole::Impl::start()` | 4096 B | 2 | Receives image notifications and calls the decode callback. Hands the server display timestamp off to the main loop, which fires the display callback at the correct time. |
| **Network** | (library-internal) | IXWebSocket (host) or esp_http_server (ESP) | - | - | WebSocket I/O. Callbacks fire on these threads and must defer work to the main loop. |

On host builds, `platform_configure_thread()` is a no-op; threads use OS defaults. On ESP-IDF it calls `esp_pthread_set_cfg()` to set stack size, priority, name, and optional PSRAM allocation before the `std::thread` is constructed.

### Thread Lifecycle

**Sync task** (`src/sync_task.cpp:620`):

1. `SyncTask::start()` configures the thread and spawns it.
2. The caller blocks until the thread reaches IDLE state (`TASK_IDLE` event flag) or exits early due to an allocation failure (`TASK_STOPPED`).
3. The thread runs a persistent outer loop for the lifetime of the client.
4. `SyncTask::stop()` sets `COMMAND_STOP` and joins the thread. Called from `SyncTask`'s destructor, which is triggered by `sync_task_.reset()` in `PlayerRole::Impl`'s destructor.

**Visualizer drain** (`src/visualizer_role.cpp`):

1. `VisualizerRole::Impl::start()` spawns the drain thread.
2. The thread blocks on ring buffer receives with a 50 ms timeout.
3. `VisualizerRole::Impl` destructor sets `COMMAND_STOP` and joins.

**Artwork decode** (`src/artwork_role.cpp`):

1. `ArtworkRole::Impl::start()` spawns the decode thread.
2. The thread blocks on notification queue receives with a 100 ms timeout.
3. On notification: calls `on_image_decode()`, then merges an `ArtworkDisplayUpdate` (the slot's server display timestamp plus the `stream_epoch` it was decoded under) into the `ArtworkRole::Impl::EventState::display_slot` `InboxSlot` via `merge_artwork_display_update`. The main loop's `ArtworkRole::Impl::drain_events()` folds the taken update into its main-thread-only `held_display_*` state and fires `on_image_display()` once the timestamp is reached. Latest-wins per slot: if a newer frame's timestamp overwrites the pending one before the main loop takes it, only the newer display fires; the per-slot epoch lets the deadline sweep drop a display whose stream was replaced after the hand-off.
4. `ArtworkRole::Impl` destructor sets `COMMAND_STOP` and joins.

**Destruction order** matters because external audio callbacks may still reference the sync task. `PlayerRole::Impl`'s destructor resets the sync task first (`sync_task_.reset()`) before tearing down anything else, so the thread is fully joined before any shared state is destroyed.

## Synchronization Primitives

All primitives are abstracted in `src/platform/` with ESP-IDF (FreeRTOS) and host (std::mutex/condition_variable) implementations.

### EventFlags (`src/platform/event_flags.h`)

Atomic bit flags with blocking wait. Used for thread lifecycle control:

```api
COMMAND_STOP         (1 << 0)   Stop the thread
COMMAND_STREAM_END   (1 << 1)   End current stream
COMMAND_STREAM_CLEAR (1 << 2)   Seek: discard buffered audio up to the stream/clear marker
COMMAND_START        (1 << 3)   Main loop acknowledged stream start
TASK_RUNNING         (1 << 8)   Actively decoding
TASK_STOPPED         (1 << 10)  Thread has exited
TASK_ERROR           (1 << 11)  Allocation or decode failure
TASK_IDLE            (1 << 12)  Waiting for work
```

The sync task, visualizer drain thread, and artwork decode thread all use event flags for command signaling from the main loop and status reporting back. The artwork decode thread uses a simpler subset: just `COMMAND_STOP`. The visualizer drain thread adds `COMMAND_FLUSH` and `COMMAND_CLEAR`. `COMMAND_CLEAR` discards buffered entries up to a 1-byte marker the network thread enqueues on `stream/start` and `stream/clear` (mirroring the sync task's clear-marker chunk) so frames received after the boundary survive; `COMMAND_FLUSH` (drain to empty) is only used when the producer is already stopped (`stream/end`, cleanup).

### ThreadSafeQueue (`src/platform/thread_safe_queue.h`)

Fixed-depth FIFO queue with timed send/receive. Used to defer events from network threads to the main loop:

| Queue | Depth | Data | Producer | Consumer |
|-------|-------|------|----------|----------|
| `ArtworkRole::Impl::notify_queue` | 8 | `ArtworkNotification` | Network thread | Artwork decode thread |

### ShadowSlot (`src/platform/shadow_slot.h`)

Single-slot state container with "latest wins" or custom merge semantics for a producer/consumer thread pair where **neither thread is the main loop**. The writer thread writes or merges; the reader thread takes the accumulated value. Main-loop-bound cross-thread state goes through the Inbox / `InboxSlot` instead (see below), which consolidates many producers onto one shared mutex and a single lock-free `poll()` read per tick. Its one remaining user is the sync task's playback-progress slot (audio-callback thread → sync-task thread):

| Shadow Slot | Data | Merge Strategy |
|-------------|------|----------------|
| `SyncTask::playback_progress_slot_` | `PlaybackProgress` | Sum `frames_played`, keep latest `finish_timestamp` |

The field-by-field merge pattern - preserving, say, a volume change and a mute change that arrive between two drain ticks because the merge only overwrites fields present in the delta - now lives on the Inbox merge slots (the player's `command_slot`, and the metadata/color/group delta slots below) rather than on a `ShadowSlot`.

### Inbox (`src/inbox.h`)

Shared main-loop mailbox that consolidates client-level cross-thread traffic behind a single mutex and a lock-free dirty-topic bitmask. It provides two endpoint styles:

- A fixed-capacity event ring (`push_event` / `take_events`) for lifecycle events, discriminated by `InboxEventType`. The ring drops on full (matching the old queue behavior) and the producer logs the drop.
- `InboxSlot<T>`, a latest-value slot (`write` / `merge` / `take`) that replaces `ShadowSlot` for a single topic. Each slot exclusively owns one `INBOX_TOPIC_*` bit.

The main loop calls `poll()` once per tick to read the bitmask lock-free and only locks the mutex to drain topics whose bit is set. A bit set by a producer just after the snapshot is never lost: it stays set until a consumer drains it, so the next tick observes it. The Inbox is a leaf in the lock order, and merge functors must be pure data operations (no callbacks into application code while the mutex is held).

State currently on the Inbox:

| Endpoint | Topic bit | Data | Producer |
|----------|-----------|------|----------|
| Event ring | `INBOX_TOPIC_EVENTS` | Lifecycle events (`TimeResponsePayload`, `PLAYER_STREAM` STREAM_START/STREAM_END, `ARTWORK_STREAM` STREAM_END/STREAM_CLEAR, `VISUALIZER_STREAM` STREAM_START/STREAM_END/STREAM_CLEAR, plus `CONTROLLER_CLEARED` / `METADATA_CLEARED` / `COLOR_CLEARED`) via `InboxEvent` | Network thread (`TimeResponsePayload`, `PLAYER_STREAM`, `ARTWORK_STREAM`, `VISUALIZER_STREAM`) / main-loop thread (`*_CLEARED` and the synthetic `cleanup()` stream events) |
| `Client::group_slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_GROUP` | `GroupUpdateObject` (field-by-field delta merge) | Network thread |
| `ControllerRole::Impl::slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_CONTROLLER` | `ServerStateControllerObject` (latest wins) | Network thread |
| `MetadataRole::Impl::slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_METADATA` | `ServerMetadataStateDelta` (field-by-field delta merge) | Network thread |
| `ColorRole::Impl::slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_COLOR` | `ServerColorStateDelta` (field-by-field delta merge) | Network thread |
| `PlayerRole::Impl::EventState::stream_params_slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_PLAYER_STREAM_PARAMS` | `ServerPlayerStreamObject` (latest wins) | Network thread |
| `PlayerRole::Impl::EventState::command_slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_PLAYER_COMMAND` | `ServerCommandMessage` (field-by-field merge) | Network thread |
| `PlayerRole::Impl::EventState::state_slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_PLAYER_STATE` | `SendspinClientState` (latest wins) | Sync task thread |
| `VisualizerRole::Impl::EventState::config_slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_VISUALIZER_CONFIG` | `ServerVisualizerStreamObject` (latest wins) | Network thread |
| `ArtworkRole::Impl::EventState::display_slot` | `INBOX_TOPIC_ARTWORK_DISPLAY` | `ArtworkDisplayUpdate` (per-slot display timestamp + epoch, merged) | Artwork decode thread |

All roles have been migrated onto the Inbox. The controller/metadata/color roles write or merge server state into their `InboxSlot` from `handle_server_state()`, and their disconnect clear arrives as a `*_CLEARED` lifecycle event on the shared ring rather than a per-role flag. The player role owns three `InboxSlot`s (stream params, command, and client state, on its `EventState`) plus `PLAYER_STREAM` lifecycle events on the shared ring; its disconnect clear is the synthetic STREAM_END that `cleanup()` pushes onto the ring. The visualizer role writes its stream config to `config_slot` and delivers STREAM_START/END/CLEAR as `VISUALIZER_STREAM` ring events (no per-tick `drain_events()`; the config is taken when the START event is dispatched). The artwork role merges per-slot display timestamps (tagged with the decode `stream_epoch`) into `display_slot`, delivers STREAM_END/CLEAR as `ARTWORK_STREAM` ring events, and keeps a per-tick `drain_events()` for its server-clock display-deadline sweep. Both roles' disconnect clears are synthetic stream events that `cleanup()` pushes onto the ring.

### SpscRingBuffer (`src/platform/spsc_ring_buffer.h`)

Single-producer/single-consumer ring buffer for variable-size binary data. Two-phase API: `acquire` → `commit` (producer), `receive` → `return_item` (consumer). Also supports a single-phase `send` for the producer.

Used for:

- **Encoded audio**: Via the `SendspinAudioRingBuffer` wrapper (which adds chunk headers and exposes `write_chunk` / `receive_chunk` / `return_chunk`). Network thread writes chunks; sync task reads and decodes them.
- **Visualizer frames**: Used directly. Network thread writes one entry per visualizer binary message; drain thread reads them at the correct playback time.

### Other Primitives

- **`std::mutex`** on `ConnectionManager::conn_mutex_`: protects deferred connection event vectors.
- **`std::mutex`** on `SendspinTimeFilter::state_mutex_`: protects Kalman filter state (offset, drift, covariance).
- **`std::atomic<bool>`** on `SendspinConnection::message_dispatch_enabled_`: allows the main loop to instantly suppress message delivery from the network thread.
- **`std::atomic<bool/uint8_t>`** on `VisualizerRole::Impl`: network thread writes stream config atomically; drain thread reads it.
- **`std::atomic<bool>`** on `ArtworkRole::Impl::stream_active`: guards `handle_binary()` from writing when no stream is active.
- **`std::atomic<uint8_t>`** on `ArtworkRole::Impl::SlotBuffer::write_idx`: tracks which of two double-buffers the network thread writes to next.
- **`std::atomic<bool>`** on `ArtworkRole::Impl::SlotBuffer::drain_active`: set by the decode thread while decoding, checked by the network thread to avoid overwriting an in-use buffer.
- **`std::atomic<uint8_t>`** on `SendspinClient::high_performance_ref_count_`: ref-counted high-performance networking requests from time sync and playback.

## Message Flow

### WebSocket Receive Path

```api
Network thread (IXWebSocket / esp_http_server)
  │
  ├─ Assembles fragmented WebSocket frames into complete messages
  │  (connection.cpp: prepare_receive_buffer_ / commit_receive_buffer_)
  │
  ├─ Checks message_dispatch_enabled_ atomic flag
  │  (returns immediately if disabled; used during teardown)
  │
  └─ Invokes callback on network thread:
     ├─ Text → SendspinClient::process_json_message_()
     └─ Binary → SendspinClient::process_binary_message_()
```

### JSON Message Dispatch (network thread)

`process_json_message()` (`src/client.cpp`) parses the message type and routes:

| Message | Action on Network Thread |
|---------|------------------------|
| `SERVER_HELLO` | Stores server info and connection reason on the connection, then sets `server_hello_received_` (an atomic store that publishes the fields to the main loop; the manager's promotion scan observes `is_handshake_complete()` on its next tick) |
| `SERVER_TIME` | Pushes a `TIME_RESPONSE` `InboxEvent` onto the shared inbox ring |
| `SERVER_STATE` | Writes/merges into the controller, metadata, and color `InboxSlot`s via each role's `handle_server_state()` |
| `SERVER_COMMAND` | Merges into the player's `command_slot` (`InboxSlot<ServerCommandMessage>`) |
| `GROUP_UPDATE` | Merges into `Client::group_slot` (`InboxSlot<GroupUpdateObject>`) |
| `STREAM_START` | Writes to the player's `stream_params_slot`, pushes a `PLAYER_STREAM` (STREAM_START) event onto the inbox ring. Marks the artwork stream active, flushes the decode thread's notification queue, bumps the artwork `stream_epoch`, and resets the artwork `display_slot`. Writes the config to the visualizer's `config_slot` and pushes a `VISUALIZER_STREAM` (STREAM_START) event onto the inbox ring. |
| `STREAM_END` | Pushes a `PLAYER_STREAM` (STREAM_END) event onto the inbox ring and signals sync task `COMMAND_STREAM_END`; pushes `ARTWORK_STREAM` (STREAM_END) and `VISUALIZER_STREAM` (STREAM_END) events onto the inbox ring |
| `STREAM_CLEAR` | Pushes `ARTWORK_STREAM` (STREAM_CLEAR) and `VISUALIZER_STREAM` (STREAM_CLEAR) events onto the inbox ring; for the player, signals sync task `COMMAND_STREAM_CLEAR` and enqueues a `CHUNK_TYPE_STREAM_CLEAR_MARKER` chunk into the encoded ring buffer (no player listener callback - a seek is not a stream lifecycle event) |

#### JSON parse arena (`src/platform/json_arena.h`)

The `JsonDocument` used to parse each incoming message comes from `make_json_document()`. By default that allocates the document's variant pool and copied strings out of PSRAM (`PsramJsonAllocator`), which puts PSRAM traffic on the CPU-hot network thread for every message. When `SendspinClientConfig::json_arena_size > 0` (the default is `2048`), `SendspinClient` instead owns a `SendspinArenaAllocator` (a fixed internal-RAM bump arena) and `process_json_message()` calls `reset()` on it and parses into a document backed by it. An allocation that does not fit the remaining budget falls back to `platform_malloc` (PSRAM-preferring), so an unexpectedly large message (e.g. track metadata) still parses, just slowly.

The bump arena suits ArduinoJson's allocation pattern: during a parse the variant pool is allocated once up front and the deserializer's string scratch buffer is always the most-recently-allocated block while it grows and shrinks, so those reallocations happen in place; document teardown frees strings newest-first and the pool last (LIFO), draining the arena back to empty on its own. `reset()` between messages is a safety net for any arena block left behind by a non-LIFO free; it cannot free PSRAM fallbacks (those are released by `deallocate()` on document teardown like any other allocation). The allocator is not thread-safe; the single instance is owned by `SendspinClient` and touched only on the network thread (`process_json_message()` runs serialized on the httpd worker task, and the previous call's `JsonDocument` is destroyed before the next call). Outgoing-message serialization in `src/protocol.cpp` still uses the PSRAM allocator.

### Binary Message Dispatch (network thread)

`process_binary_message()` extracts the type byte and routes:

| Binary Type | Handler |
|-------------|---------|
| Player audio | `PlayerRole::Impl::handle_binary()`: writes to encoded audio ring buffer |
| Artwork image | `ArtworkRole::Impl::handle_binary()`: copies image data to a per-slot double buffer and enqueues a notification for the artwork decode thread |
| Visualizer data (binary types 16-20) | `VisualizerRole::Impl::handle_binary()`: writes to visualizer ring buffer |

### Main Loop Processing

`SendspinClient::loop()` (`src/client.cpp`) runs the following steps **in order** on each tick:

```api
1. connection_manager_->loop()   (sections gated on lock-free atomic hints - see below)
   ├─ Start WS server if network ready
   ├─ Swap deferred connection events under mutex   (only when has_pending_events_)
   ├─ Process close/disconnect events (on_connection_lost)
   ├─ Promotion scan: establish nursery connections whose hello handshake completed
   │  (handoff decisions against the incumbent)
   ├─ Call loop() on the current and nursery connections   (only when has_current_ or nursery_size_)
   ├─ Check per-connection hello retry timers   (only when nursery_size_)
   ├─ Reap nursery connections past the establish deadline; tick the platform ws_server
   └─ flush_deferred_releases()   (early-returns without locking when deferred_size_ is 0)

2. time_burst_->loop(conn)  (skipped when no current connection)
   ├─ Send next time message if ready
   ├─ Acquire/release high-performance networking around burst
   └─ Notify listener of sync error when burst completes

3. Drain inbox event ring (when INBOX_TOPIC_EVENTS is set)
   ├─ Feed TIME_RESPONSE events into time_burst_->on_time_response()
   ├─ Fire CONTROLLER/METADATA/COLOR_CLEARED via each role's handle_cleared_event()
   ├─ Dispatch PLAYER_STREAM via player_->impl_->on_stream_ring_event()
   ├─ Dispatch ARTWORK_STREAM via artwork_->impl_->handle_stream_ring_event()
   └─ Dispatch VISUALIZER_STREAM via visualizer_->impl_->handle_stream_ring_event()

4. Role event draining (each role's impl_->drain_events(), gated on impl_->needs_drain(slot_bits))
   ├─ player_->impl_->drain_events()
   ├─ controller_->impl_->drain_events()
   ├─ metadata_->impl_->drain_events()
   ├─ color_->impl_->drain_events()
   └─ artwork_->impl_->drain_events()   (display-deadline sweep; visualizer has no drain_events())

5. Drain group_slot (when INBOX_TOPIC_GROUP is set in slot_bits)
   └─ Apply group deltas, fire on_group_update, persist last played server
```

This ordering matters: connection lifecycle events are processed before role events, and time sync before audio processing, so that roles always see a consistent connection and time state.

Each `loop()` section that would otherwise take a mutex first consults a lock-free atomic hint, so an idle tick pays only for the atomic loads it needs to decide there is nothing to do. `ConnectionManager` keeps four such hints, each refreshed under the owning mutex right after the container/pointer it mirrors changes (always re-derived from `.size()` or the assigned value, never incremented in place, so the hint cannot drift from ground truth):

- `has_pending_events_` (under `conn_mutex_`): set at every push into either deferred connection-event queue, cleared once `loop()` has swapped both out. Lets `loop()` skip the `conn_mutex_` acquisition when neither queue has anything pending.
- `nursery_size_` (under `conn_ptr_mutex_`): mirrors `nursery_.size()`. Lets `loop()` skip the current/nursery copy-and-`loop()` block, the hello-retry scan, and the nursery reap scan when the nursery is empty, while keeping the lifecycle block running while any nursery connection exists (its promotion scan is level-triggered on connection flags, not on events).
- `has_current_` (under `conn_ptr_mutex_`): true whenever `current_connection_` is non-null. Lets `loop()` skip the copy-and-`loop()` block when there is no current connection and the nursery is empty.
- `deferred_size_` (under `conn_ptr_mutex_`): mirrors `deferred_releases_.size()`. Lets `flush_deferred_releases()` early-return without locking when nothing is queued.

Steady state is therefore cheap: connected-and-idle costs one `conn_ptr_mutex_` acquisition (the current/nursery copy ahead of the `conn->loop()` calls) plus a handful of atomic loads; disconnected-and-idle costs zero mutex acquisitions. The mutex-protected containers and pointers remain the ground truth in every case; the hints only decide whether it is worth locking to look.

The Inbox drain steps gate the same way, off two lock-free `poll()` snapshots of the topic bitmask. `inbox_bits` is taken first and gates only the event-ring drain (step 3). `slot_bits` is taken *after* that drain completes and gates the role drains (step 4) and the group drain (step 5); the second snapshot catches topic bits a producer set while the ring drain was running (including a ring event's own side effects re-entering the inbox). A bit either snapshot races and misses is not lost - it stays set and the next tick's `poll()` observes it (bounded staleness, per `Inbox::poll()`). Each role's `needs_drain(slot_bits)` decides whether its drain runs: mostly a simple `slot_bits & INBOX_TOPIC_*` test, but the player, metadata, and artwork roles OR in a main-thread-only carry-over term (the player's `awaiting_sync_idle_events`, the metadata role's future-dated `held_delta`, the artwork role's nonzero `held_display_mask`) so that work waiting out a deadline no inbox bit tracks still gets a drain every tick until it fires.

## Role Event Draining

Most roles implement `drain_events()` to process their deferred state on the main loop thread; stream lifecycle events instead ride the shared inbox ring and are dispatched from the ring drain (step 3 above) via each role's `handle_stream_ring_event()` / `on_stream_ring_event()` / `handle_cleared_event()`. Together these convert cross-thread inbox writes into sequential, single-threaded callback delivery. (The visualizer role has no `drain_events()` - all its delivery is ring-driven.)

### PlayerRole::Impl::drain_events() (`src/player_role.cpp:363`)

Three stages, processed in order:

**1. Client state updates**: Takes from `state_slot` (latest-wins `InboxSlot`, written by the sync task). Calls `client_->update_state()`.

**2. Server commands**: Takes from `command_slot`. Checks each field independently (volume, mute, static_delay) and fires the corresponding listener callback.

**3. Stream lifecycle**: The most complex part:

```api
PLAYER_STREAM ring events → on_stream_ring_event() → awaiting_sync_idle_events list
                       │
                       ▼
         For each event in order:
           ├─ STREAM_END:
           │    If sync task is still running → wait for next tick
           │    If sync task is idle → fire on_stream_end(), continue
           │
           └─ STREAM_START:
                Take stream_params_slot
                Mark stream active, fire on_stream_start()
                Signal sync task COMMAND_START
```

The `awaiting_sync_idle_events` list (on `PlayerRole::Impl`) is the key ordering mechanism. STREAM_END callbacks are held until the sync task has reached its IDLE state, preventing the main loop from processing a new STREAM_START before the sync task has finished with the old stream. Events ahead of the blocked event also wait, preserving FIFO order. (`stream/clear` is not queued here — it is handled synchronously in `handle_stream_clear()` by signaling the sync task and enqueuing a marker chunk.)

### Other Roles

- **ControllerRole**: Takes the latest `ServerStateControllerObject` from its `InboxSlot`, fires `on_controller_state()`. The disconnect clear is not handled here; it arrives as a `CONTROLLER_CLEARED` event on the shared ring, whose `handle_cleared_event()` fires `on_controller_state_clear()` (deferred from `cleanup()` to avoid invoking the listener while `ConnectionManager` holds `conn_ptr_mutex_`).
- **MetadataRole**: `InboxSlot` has no `take_if`, so the deadline gate that used to run under the shadow slot's mutex is split in two: `take()` unconditionally moves any pending delta into a main-thread-only `held_delta` (folding it into an already-held delta), then the server-clock deadline is evaluated with no lock held, applying deltas and firing `on_metadata()` once the `timestamp` is reached (or immediately if there is no active connection). A future-dated `held_delta` persists across ticks with no topic bit set, which is why `needs_drain()` ORs in `held_delta.has_value()` alongside the `INBOX_TOPIC_METADATA` bit test: the deadline sets no inbox bit, so without that term a bit-gated tick would strand the delta until an unrelated new delta happened to re-set the bit, silently starving deadline-based delivery. The clear arrives separately as a `METADATA_CLEARED` ring event (`handle_cleared_event()` fires `on_metadata_clear()`), deferred from `cleanup()` for the same `conn_ptr_mutex_` reason.
- **ColorRole**: Same structure as MetadataRole: `take()` into `held_delta`, a lock-free server-clock deadline gate firing `on_color()`, and a `COLOR_CLEARED` ring event driving `on_color_clear()`.
- **ArtworkRole**: Stream end/clear lifecycle is handled earlier in the tick by `handle_stream_ring_event()` (dispatched from the ring drain, before this call), which clears `held_display_mask`/`display_slot` and fires `on_image_clear()` for each configured slot - preserving the "lifecycle before display" ordering the old single-function drain guaranteed. `drain_events()` itself folds any taken `display_slot` update into the main-thread-only `held_display_*` state (latest-wins per slot), then sweeps the held slots and fires `on_image_display(slot, lateness_ms)` for any whose timestamp is due on the synced client clock (or immediately if there is no active connection). The deadline is computed by the pure `display_overdue_us()` helper, which applies the slot's `display_offset_ms` shift (positive fires early) and returns the overdue microseconds; `display_lateness_ms()` maps that to the `lateness_ms` argument, reserving `0` for the no-connection case (a connected on-time display is floored to 1 ms so it never collides with that sentinel). Per-slot epochs drop a held display whose stream was replaced after the decode hand-off. `needs_drain()` ORs a nonzero `held_display_mask` into the `INBOX_TOPIC_ARTWORK_DISPLAY` bit test (the same carry-over pattern the metadata role uses for `held_delta`) so held displays keep getting a drain every tick until their deadline fires, even though the deadline sets no inbox bit; `on_image_decode` still happens on the dedicated artwork decode thread.
  - **Ack gate (`require_frame_done`)**: A slot can opt into per-slot back-pressure. Each `SlotBuffer` carries a `SlotAckState` (`IDLE` -> `DECODE_DELIVERED` once `on_image_decode()` fires -> `PRESENTED` once `on_image_display()`/`on_image_clear()` fires), all guarded by `slot_mutex`. While a gated slot is not `IDLE`, the decode thread (`process_notification()`) does not decode a newer notification; it *parks* it latest-wins in `SlotBuffer::parked` (`has_parked`) instead of decoding concurrently with the un-acked delivery. `ArtworkRole::frame_done(slot)` (main loop) returns the gate to `IDLE` and, if a notification is parked, calls `wake_drain_thread()` -- a sentinel `ARTWORK_RECHECK_SLOT` notification that unblocks the decode thread's `notify_queue.receive()` so it re-runs the top-of-loop parked-slot sweep (a dropped wake is covered by the `DRAIN_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` fallback). The parked notification is re-validated on replay, so a since-stale generation/epoch is simply skipped. A clear counts as a delivery: `handle_stream_ring_event()` drops any parked notification and forces gated slots to `PRESENTED`, so exactly one `frame_done()` is owed after it. A stream restart releases only `DECODE_DELIVERED` slots (their display can no longer fire); `PRESENTED` stays armed because the consumer may still be mid-fade on the prior stream's last delivery. There is no timeout.
- **VisualizerRole**: Has no `drain_events()`. STREAM_START/END/CLEAR are dispatched entirely from `handle_stream_ring_event()` (from the ring drain): STREAM_START `take()`s the config from `config_slot` and fires `on_visualizer_stream_start()`; STREAM_END/CLEAR fire `on_visualizer_stream_end()`/`on_visualizer_stream_clear()`.

## Sync Task State Machine

The sync task (`SyncTask::thread_entry`, `src/sync_task.cpp`) runs a two-level state machine on its dedicated thread.

```

The **WAIT FOR CLIENT ACK** step is critical. Without it, the sync task could race from IDLE back to ACTIVE so fast that the main loop never observes TASK_IDLE, and the `awaiting_sync_idle_events` mechanism in `PlayerRole::drain_events()` would deadlock waiting for an idle transition that already passed.

### Inner State Machine (active stream)

```api
INITIAL_SYNC ──→ LOAD_CHUNK ──→ SYNCHRONIZE_AUDIO ──→ TRANSFER_AUDIO
     │                ▲               │                       │
     │                └───────────────┴───────────────────────┘
     │                        (cycle per chunk)
     └──→ LOAD_CHUNK (once first playback progress callback confirms frames were consumed)
```

**INITIAL_SYNC**: Fills the audio pipeline with silence to prime DMA buffers. Sleeps briefly after sending to let the audio stack start consuming. Once the first playback-progress callback confirms frames were consumed, it queues `extra_startup_silence_ms` of additional silence (see `PlayerRoleConfig`) and drains it before advancing to LOAD_CHUNK. This extra lead gives the decode pipeline slack to stay ahead of the sink at stream start, preventing the initial-playback stutter caused by the decoder briefly falling behind.

**LOAD_CHUNK**: Reads the next encoded chunk from the ring buffer. Waits for time sync if not yet available. Decodes audio via FLAC/Opus/PCM decoder. When `adaptive_clock.enabled` is true, decoded PCM then passes through the streaming fixed-point polyphase windowed-sinc ASRC. Its source-frame position is kept on the server-derived timeline, so the small FIR look-ahead does not change the timestamp assigned to the emitted audio. On a ring-buffer underflow (no chunk ready) **while still aligning** (startup or post-seek), it feeds silence toward the sink to keep the DAC fed while the decode pipeline catches up, instead of letting it run dry; SYNCHRONIZE_AUDIO then re-aligns the next chunk against wherever the silence carried us. In steady state it does **not** fill — an empty buffer there means the stream is winding down, and stuffing silence would pile up in the sink and delay a rapid restart (a genuine underrun instead surfaces as an error in SYNCHRONIZE_AUDIO).

**SYNCHRONIZE_AUDIO**: Computes the sync error:

```cpp
error = decoded_timestamp - new_audio_client_playtime
```

Where `decoded_timestamp` is the server timestamp converted to client time (via Kalman filter) minus static and fixed delays, and `new_audio_client_playtime` is the predicted time that the next audio will actually play.

| Error Range | Action |
|-------------|--------|
| > +5000 us (or +500 us settling) | **Hard sync ahead**: insert silence frames to fill the gap |
| < -5000 us (or -500 us settling) | **Hard sync behind**: drop the decoded chunk |
| -5000 to +5000 us | **Adaptive clock**: a deadbanded PI controller converts persistent endpoint error into a slew-limited ASRC correction (default maximum ±500 ppm) |

Hard sync resets the PI correction to nominal speed and sets a flag that switches to a tighter 500 us settle threshold until the error is small enough to exit hard sync mode. When adaptive correction is disabled, the legacy soft-sync behavior remains available: errors outside the ±100 us dead zone insert or remove one blended frame.

**TRANSFER_AUDIO**: Writes PCM data to the audio sink via `on_audio_write`. If silence was inserted (hard sync ahead), transfers silence first, then re-enters SYNCHRONIZE_AUDIO for the held-back decoded data.

### Playback Progress Tracking

The audio output hardware reports consumed frames via `notify_audio_played()` → `playback_progress_slot_` (a `ShadowSlot` whose merge strategy sums `frames_played` across unread updates and keeps the latest `finish_timestamp`). The sync task takes the accumulated value on every inner loop iteration to maintain an accurate `new_audio_client_playtime` estimate:

```cpp
new_audio_client_playtime = last_finish_timestamp + remaining_buffered_frames_as_microseconds
```

This feedback loop is what makes the sync error calculation accurate. With adaptive clocking enabled, the same endpoint error drives a PI controller every 250 ms. Positive error requests more output frames; negative error requests fewer. The 32-tap, 128-phase windowed-sinc ASRC applies that correction continuously rather than concentrating it in occasional inserted or removed frames. Coefficients are shared in static storage, while streaming PCM history/output uses the external-memory-preferring platform allocator on ESP.

## Time Synchronization

### Burst Strategy (`src/time_burst.h`)

Time sync uses a burst-based NTP-style protocol:

1. Send 8 time request messages per burst (each with a 10-second response timeout).
2. Wait 10 seconds between bursts.
3. Select the measurement with the lowest round-trip time (lowest `max_error`).
4. Feed the best measurement into the Kalman filter.

High-performance networking (e.g., disabling WiFi power saving) is acquired for the duration of a burst and released when complete.

### Kalman Filter (`src/time_filter.h`)

Two-dimensional state vector: `[offset, drift]`.

- First measurement establishes the offset baseline.
- Second measurement estimates initial drift from finite differences.
- Subsequent measurements: predict offset forward by `drift * dt`, then correct using the new measurement.
- Adaptive forgetting: if the residual exceeds `3.0 * max_error`, the covariance is inflated by a forgetting factor (2.0) to recover from step changes.
- Drift compensation is only enabled after 100 samples and only when drift significance exceeds its noise floor.

The filter is protected by `state_mutex_` so that `compute_client_time()` can be called from the sync task thread while `update()` runs from the main loop thread.

## Connection Lifecycle

### Connection Management (`src/connection_manager.cpp`)

The `ConnectionManager` maintains one established slot plus a bounded nursery of unproven connections:

| Slot | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `current_connection_` | Active connection receiving messages; holds only connections that completed the hello handshake |
| `nursery_` | Unproven connections (inbound or outbound) awaiting establishment, bounded by `NURSERY_CAPACITY` inbound + 1 outbound |

All are `std::shared_ptr<SendspinConnection>`, and on the ESP server path they are observers rather than authoritative owners; the authoritative owner of a `SendspinServerConnection` is the httpd session itself (see [Server connection ownership (ESP)](#server-connection-ownership-esp)). On the host (IXWebSocket) client path the `shared_ptr` in these slots is the only owner.

### Handshake and Handoff

1. A new connection (outbound or inbound) enters the nursery. Inbound connections are delivered by the platform ws_server only after their WebSocket upgrade is observed.
2. The connection sends a CLIENT_HELLO. Retry with exponential backoff (100 ms base, 3 attempts). Each managed connection has its own retry entry in `ConnectionManager::hello_retries_`, so a handoff candidate arriving mid-handshake cannot clobber another connection's pending hello.
3. The handshake state lives on the connection as two atomic flags: `client_hello_sent_` (set by the hello send-completion callback) and `server_hello_received_` (set when SERVER_HELLO is processed on the network thread, after the server info fields it publishes).
4. Establishment is level-triggered: each `loop()` tick, the promotion scan promotes any nursery connection whose `is_handshake_complete()` is true, so the order in which the two flags were set is irrelevant. If an incumbent exists, the handoff decision runs:
   - Prefer PLAYBACK reason over DISCOVERY.
   - Among two DISCOVERY connections, prefer the last-played server.
   - Default: keep current.
5. Handoff executes: disable the loser's message dispatch → cleanup client state (winner only gets `on_handshake_complete`) → send goodbye to the rejected connection via the deferred-release queue.

### Disconnection and Cleanup

When a connection is lost (`on_connection_lost`):

```api
1. conn->disable_message_dispatch()      ← atomic, immediate on network thread
2. client_->cleanup_connection_state()  ← stop time sync, reset the inbox event ring and every
                                           role's slots, signal stream end
3. Queue the connection on deferred_releases_ (released outside the manager lock)
4. The current slot stays empty; the next promotion scan fills it from the nursery
```

`disable_message_dispatch()` is the first step because it's an atomic flag that the network thread checks before invoking any callback. This prevents stale messages from a dead connection from racing into freshly-reset role queues.

### Graceful Disconnect

`disconnect_and_release()` calls `conn->disconnect(reason, nullptr)` and lets the local `shared_ptr` go out of scope.

- **ESP server**: the goodbye text is queued as an httpd worker job. The worker resolves the connection by `lock()`ing the `weak_ptr` captured in the queued arg when the goodbye was enqueued; if it resolves it sends the frame, then runs the completion lambda that calls `trigger_close()`. The session slot installed in `open_callback` keeps the connection alive across that whole sequence even after `ConnectionManager`'s observer `shared_ptr` is dropped. The session is finally freed when httpd invokes the slot's `free_fn` (see [Server connection ownership (ESP)](#server-connection-ownership-esp)). The completion lambda also captures a `weak_ptr` to make this lifetime explicit — `trigger_close()` is skipped if the conn has already been freed. Goodbye is one of the two messages that pass `allow_before_hello=true`, so it is not blocked by the pre-hello send gate (a rejected connection is told to leave before it ever sends a hello).
- **Host client**: the IXWebSocket send is synchronous, so the goodbye and close have both completed by the time `disconnect()` returns and the `shared_ptr` drops the last reference.

### Server connection ownership (ESP)

On the ESP build, `SendspinServerConnection` lifetime is pinned to the httpd session rather than to `ConnectionManager`:

1. `SendspinWsServer::open_callback` (the httpd `open_fn`) creates the `shared_ptr<SendspinServerConnection>`, heap-allocates a `shared_ptr*` slot, and calls `httpd_sess_set_ctx(handle, sockfd, slot, free_fn)` with a deleter that `delete`s the slot. That slot is the authoritative reference.
2. The same shared_ptr is forwarded into `ConnectionManager::on_new_connection`, which admits it into the nursery as a *secondary observer* (it moves to `current_connection_` only once its hello handshake completes).
3. The httpd WebSocket handler (`websocket_handler`) looks the connection up by `httpd_sess_get_ctx(handle, sockfd)` at run time, copying the slot's `shared_ptr` for the duration of its work; it never assumes the manager's observer slot is alive. The queued send workers (`async_send_text`, `async_send_time_text`) instead capture a `weak_ptr<SendspinServerConnection>` to the originating connection and `lock()` it when they run.
4. When the socket closes, httpd calls the `close_fn` first (which fires `connection_closed_callback_` so `ConnectionManager` can drop its observer in the next `loop()`), then later calls the slot's `free_fn` to release the authoritative reference once no workers are queued for that session.

Queued send workers capture a `weak_ptr<SendspinServerConnection>` to the originating connection — `AsyncRespArg` for text sends, `SessionLookup` for time sends — and `lock()` it when the worker runs. This is deliberately **not** a `{httpd_handle_t, int sockfd}` pair: identifying the target by sockfd risked binding to a *different* connection that had recycled the same fd after the original closed, sending a frame to the wrong peer. The `weak_ptr` resolves to the exact connection that queued the work, or to null if it has since been destroyed, in which case the worker no-ops cleanly. Because these structs now hold non-trivial members (the `weak_ptr`, and `AsyncRespArg`'s completion `std::function`), they are constructed with placement-new and explicitly destroyed before `platform_free` rather than treated as POD. Both are allocated through `platform_malloc` / `platform_malloc_internal`.

The send workers also enforce the protocol's "hello is always first" rule: a frame is dropped unless `client_hello_sent_` is set on the resolved connection, *unless* the caller passed `allow_before_hello=true`. Exactly two callers do — the `client/hello` itself (which would otherwise gate its own send and deadlock) and `goodbye` — so a stale or out-of-order frame can never precede the handshake. The `weak_ptr` guards identity; the gate guards ordering; the two are independent.

The host build does not need this scheme: `SendspinWsServer` (host) routes IXWebSocket messages by calling `find_connection_callback_` to resolve a synthetic sockfd back to the connection that `ConnectionManager` is holding. The ESP build keeps the `set_find_connection_callback()` setter as a no-op stub for symmetry; see the comment at the call site in `ConnectionManager::init_server`.

## Ordering Guarantees Summary

### Network Thread → Main Loop

All network thread actions are deferred to the main loop, primarily through the shared `Inbox` (its event ring and `InboxSlot`s), with a few remaining per-thread queues and mutex-protected vectors. The main loop processes them in a fixed order each tick (connections → time → roles → group). This guarantees that:

- Connection state is settled before roles process events.
- Time sync is updated before audio sync decisions.
- Role events fire in FIFO order per role.

### Stream Lifecycle Ordering

The combination of `awaiting_sync_idle_events` (main loop) and `COMMAND_START` (sync task wait) creates a two-way handshake:

1. Network thread pushes STREAM_END → STREAM_START as `PLAYER_STREAM` events onto the inbox event ring.
2. Sync task receives `COMMAND_STREAM_END`, finishes active stream, enters IDLE, sets `TASK_IDLE`.
3. Main loop drains the ring into `awaiting_sync_idle_events`, sees STREAM_END, checks `is_running()` → false (idle), fires `on_stream_end()`.
4. Main loop sees STREAM_START, fires `on_stream_start()`, signals `COMMAND_START`.
5. Sync task receives `COMMAND_START`, exits wait, enters ACTIVE.

This prevents the sync task from starting a new stream before the main loop has processed the end of the old one.

### Playback Progress

Audio output callbacks run on a platform audio thread. They report consumed frames via `notify_audio_played()` → `playback_progress_slot_` (merging sums frames and keeps the latest timestamp). The sync task takes the accumulated value non-blockingly on each iteration of its inner loop, keeping the playtime estimate accurate without blocking the audio thread.

### Cleanup Atomicity

`disable_message_dispatch()` + queue draining + event flag signaling ensures that after cleanup:

- No new messages will be delivered from the old connection.
- All pending events are discarded.
- The sync task is signaled to end its current stream.
- The main loop will process the synthetic STREAM_END on its next tick.

### Re-entrant Teardown During Callback Dispatch

A listener callback fired from the main loop can synchronously re-enter connection teardown - for example an `on_stream_start()` or `on_*_clear()` handler that calls `connect_to()`, whose `drop_connection()` runs `cleanup_connection_state()` on the same stack. That cleanup wipes the inbox event ring (`reset_events()`) and each role re-pushes its synthetic clear/STREAM_END, so a drain already in progress must not act on the stale events it copied out before the wipe. Two plain `uint32_t` generation counters, both touched only on the main loop, guard this:

- `SendspinClient::event_state_->drain_generation`, bumped by `cleanup_connection_state()`. The event-ring drain in `loop()` snapshots it before the batch and aborts the instant it changes, discarding the events it had already copied out (they were wiped deliberately) and leaving the cleanup's freshly re-pushed events in the live ring for the next tick. The abort is checked both at the top of the inner per-event loop and once more after the loop body, so a teardown that re-enters on the final event of a full batch cannot fall through into a second `take_events()` that would destructively pull, and then drop, those re-pushed events.
- `PlayerRole::Impl::cleanup_generation`, bumped by the player's `cleanup()`. `drain_events()` snapshots it around each `on_stream_start()` call; if it changes, the stream was torn down from inside the callback, so the player abandons the rest of the batch rather than re-arm the sync task for a dead stream. `stream_active` is set before the callback runs, so the STREAM_END that `cleanup()` enqueued still passes its gate and delivers a paired `on_stream_end()`.

Neither counter needs atomics: they only let an in-flight drain notice that teardown ran underneath it and stop touching state that cleanup already reset.
